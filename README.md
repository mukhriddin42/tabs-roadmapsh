To strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript, I tried to complete the Tabs task in Roadmapsh. I used JS for interactivity. Some parts would have been easier if I had done it in CSS, but I wrote it in JS DOM to strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript.
Thank you for visiting.
You can see the task in the following: https://tabs-roadmapsh.vercel.app/
